# Robotics

This Project was developed for the Robotics exam in Summer 2015 (Mark: 30/30).
It consists of a robot navigation algorithm: the robot has to reach a goal in a labyrinth without knowing the target location, using proximity sensors and the current distance to the target. We used the well-known BUG-1 algorithm
In particular, I focused on the trilateration algorithm logic and the decision making problem regarding whether switching between "boundary following" and "motion to goal", given the trilateration data acquired.
